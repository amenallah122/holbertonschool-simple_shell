# Simple Shell

## Description ##

**hsh** is a simple UNIX command language interpreter that reads commands from either a file or standard input and executes them.
It also checks to see if the userâ€™s command inputs are correct.

<h3>Usage</h3>

After compilation, the resulting program can run stand-alone, either in interactive or non-interactive mode.

<h4>Interactive Mode</h4>

In interactive mode, simply run the program and wait for the prompt to appear. 

From there, you can type commands freely, exiting with either the "exit" command or ctrl-D.

<h5>Non-Interactive Mode</h5>

In non-interactive mode, echo your desired command and pipe it into the program like this:

```echo "cd" | ./shell```

In non-interactive mode, the program will exit after finishing your desired command(s).
